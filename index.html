            <p>Welcome to my first webpage! My name is Laura, I am 22 and I am from Brazil. I served my mission there and some months later I moved to Utah to learn English and learn everything that I could learn from this experience, both professionally and personally. In addition, I got married last August, and it has been one of the best experiences in my life! I love music and sports. Also, I studied and worked with IT before my mission and now am starting my degree at BYU-I.</p>

            <p>Brazil, the largest country in South America, boasts a diverse and vibrant cultural tapestry. Known for its iconic Amazon rainforest, Brazil is a biodiversity hotspot, housing a remarkable array of flora and fauna. The country is celebrated for its passionate embrace of music and dance, with samba and bossa nova reflecting its lively spirit. Brazil has a rich history shaped by indigenous cultures, colonial influences, and a vibrant Afro-Brazilian heritage. The bustling cities, such as Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo, showcase modernity alongside historic landmarks like the Christ the Redeemer statue.
